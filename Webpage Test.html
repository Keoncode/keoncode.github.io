  <h1>This site is dedicated to Jigglypuff.</h1>
<P>Jigglypuff is by far the cutest pokemon to ever make it into smash. She is very light yet very powerful if you know what you're doing. Combine her light weight and power and you can overtake almost anyone. Her key weakness though is her very bad range and very light weight. Jigglypuff is a very underrated character in smash and she deserves more attention.</P>
