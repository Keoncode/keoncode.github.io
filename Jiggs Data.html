       <td>Utilt(Up Tilt)</td>
       <td>9%</td>
       <td> Jigglypuff kicks her back leg up creating a vertical hitbox that covers her whole backside and a small amount of her head, this move almost never hits an enemy in front of you (I say almost never because it can hit large enemies and, very very close enemies.) Low range.</td>

       </td>
       <td> Jigglypuff puts her full body into a giant forward kick that sends enemies flying forward if sweetspot,or backwards if sourspot. It's a mid range attack and has good knockback at high percents, a good finisher but it's not safe having a long cool down.</td>

       </td>
       <td> Jigglypuff crouches with a very innocent or confused look on her face <3 and proceeds to headbutt the enemy upwards, launching the enemy straight up with an animation that closely resembles Mario and Luigi's Usmash. It's a decent sized hitbox over her head but be aware that her head is not invincible like Mario and the animation lasts a lot longer with about the same amount of cool down as her Fsmash making it an unsafe move.</td>

        <td>Dsmash(Down Smash)</td>

        (Fully Charged)15%<br />
        </td>
        <td> Jigglypuff does a super kawaii twirl (when charged) on her tippy toes and then releases a low range kick that always ALWAYS knocks the enemy straight ahead, her feet are invincible though. It's a great move to deal with people on the ledge below you or to get enemies knockedback far enough to gimp them.</td>

    <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>Nair(Neautral Air)</td>
    <td>11% Sweetspot 6% Soft</td>
    <td> Jigglypuff jumps into the air and kicks both her feet out at the same time, which can be used to hit enemies in front and behind her. This move has a very long lasting hitbox making it probably her best move in the air to start combos or to push enemies back with the wall of pain. It's longlasting hitbox and very low cooldown makes it a safe useful move in the air. 10/10 would spam again.</td>
   <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>Fair(Forward Air)</td>
    <td> 9%Sweetspot 6% Soft</td>
    <td> Jigglypuff jumps and kicks forward with both her feet! This move is an amazing combo starter it can combo into itself or into a nair making it easy to push enemies off screen for a while. This move has slightly less time on its hitbox but it's fast and very safe if you float in and out with it. 2nd best aerial.</td>
   <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>Bair(Back Air)</td>
    <td>13%</td>
    <td> The moment we've ALL been waiting for, the infamous BACK AIR! Jigglypuff does a full spin in midair and kicks back with her back foot! This move has AMAZING knockback and is her best kill move! Bair is so good it almost feels wrong to spam it on enemies trying their best to return onstage. This move can kill almost everyone at 120% on the opposite end of the stage!! (around 140-160 for heavies).</td>
   <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>Uair(Up Air)</td>
    <td>9%</td>
    <td> Jigglypuff sweeps the air with a small ranged overhead slap. This move isnt bad...BUT it isnt good, it can be used to juggle but its so small that an enemy has to be either big or very dumb to keep getting hit by it more than 3 times.</td>
   <tr style="vertical align:top">
    <td>Dair(Down Air)</td>
    <td>2%(For each kick if sweetspot) which does around 14% in total.<br />
    1% soft (For each kick) which does about 12% total.</td>
    <td> Jigglypuff jumps into the air and kicks her feet downward in a drilling motion similar to Kirby's downair. This move however has no meteor effect no matter what, it always pops enemies UP or out. This move is in the same boat with Uair except I'd consider it worse since it doesnt even spike or anything.</td>

  <tr style="vertical-align:top">
   <td>Neautural B (Rollout)</td>
   <td>14%</td>
   <td> Jigglypuff begins to charge a roll as you hold the special button, it then gets gradually faster and faster until she let's out a cute "Jiggly" which indicates it is fully charged, she then charges the enemy at full speed. This move is by far her worst move in my opinion for multiple reasons. For 1 if you don't charge it or press it by accident she does no damage and she is stuck in an animation that can be punished. 2 if you DO hit with the move you are then left spinning in mid air until you land...meaning if you hit off stage you will spin slowly to your death, and if you hit an enemie's sheild onstage you will be punished. Now for the final reason...it's so unpredictable  you can even SD if you flyout too far. So i'd say this move is her worst since it has so many negatives with only 1 plus side being it breaks shields if hit multiple times, oh and it can kill.</td>
   </tr>
  <tr style="vertical-aling:top">
   <td>Side B (Pound)</td>
   <td>11%</td>
   <td> This move is Jigglypuff's 2nd best special move. Jigglypuff slaps with her hand in a forward motion that ALWAYS knocks your enemy up!!! It's a VERY good move to approach with in my opinion since it has a decent amount of range since the hitbox on it is sooo weird, and it does HUGE amounts of sheild damage which can make the enemy afraid to sheild early in the match (1 hit makes the sheild small enough that just about all of her attacks can hit a shielding enemy, 2 will finish the sheild)! This move can be combod into aerials or (if you're good enough) a REST!</td>
 <tr style="vertcial-align:top">
  <td> Up B (Sing)</td>
  <td>0%</td>
  <td> Jigglypuff sings her famous song, making ANYONE in range fall asleep! Now I know what you're thinking 0%!?!? wtf man, but this move is A VERY good move if you can get a good read on someone since it puts them to sleep instantly and depending on how much percent they have it can keep them asleep for a long time! This move also does the opposite of what a normal Up B does..instead of helping you back onstage it makes you sink faster if you're offstage, so BE CAREFUL!! So if you combine this move with rest or a fully charged Smash attack you're good to go, but if you do it thinking you'll get some kind of air boost you're sadly mistaking.(This move can be used in mid air if you're near the ledge, so if your enemy is trying to dsmash you or trying to keep you offstage you can sing them to sleep NEAR THE LEDGE and she will cancel the song and grab the ledge)Oooh, yea P.S the range of the move increases depending on the part of the song she's on for example, the Jigg part of the song has a very low range and the ally part has a low range while the puff part can even reach outside of the animated melody barrier.</td>
 <tr style="vertical-align:top"> 
  <td> Down B (Rest)</td>
  <td>20% when hit directly and the flower stuck on the enemies head can do up to 35 extra, in total about 55%!!</td>
  <td>Oh God...this move, THIS is her BEST MOVE PERIOD in my opinion. Jigglypuff simply takes a nap. Yup that's it. LOL no really if you use this move away from the enemy you will be sleeping for 5 seconds which is PLENTY of time for a deadly punish. BUT if you use it touching anyone(at the right killpercent) YOU CAN INSTANTLY KO THEM!! Crazy right? Oh, but don't let my hype confuse you into thinking this is a super solid amazing move because while it IS it can be predictable. If someone sheild it (it does HUGE sheild damage)you are pretty much gone. This move can be used in doubles to change the fate of battle, since you will not get punished if your teammate jabs you out of the sleep animation making this a move that can be used in such a wide amount of ways.

  <td> Jigglypuff runs and charges headfirst into the enemy knocking them back not too far at low percent's making it a good move to combo into itself and then can be finished with a wall of pain, but at high percent it is a kill move. Be aware that Jigglypuff is very slow even while running so it isnt super safe to use alot and can be very very easy to predict and counter.</td>

  <td>Dthrow(Down Throw)</td>
  <td>10%</td>
  <td> Jigglypuff slams the enemy on the ground and rolls on their back sending the enemy shooting straight up. This move can be combo'd into uair or other air attacks since it dosen't send them up too far keeping them in good reach for follow ups. (In melee each roll did a small amount of damage but in smash 4 the whole animation has to be complete in order for the enemy to take damage)</td>

  <td>Uthrow (Up Throw)
  <td>10%</td>
  <td> Jigglypuff grabs the enemy and twirls them up into the air. While this move is considered her kill throw I don't see it as a kill throw since it usually takes around 200% to kill most enemies. However you can punish a predictable air dodge with a rest.</td>
 <tr style="vertical-align:top">
  <td>Jump</td>
  <td>0%</td>
  <td> Jigglypuff jumps into the air doing a small flip as she reaches her jumps peak.Now as we all know Jigglypuff has no recovery and here is why, she has 6 jumps!!!! Each jump is slightly less high but the first few can get you just about anywhere. She can easily go understage with her jumps as well.</td>

  <h1> Summary</h1>
  <p> So to sum up Jigglypuff in my own opinion I'd say she's THE BEST CHARACTER EVER IN SMASH, but we would all know that's a lie. Jigglypuff is the lightest character in the entire game, meaning other characters can KO her at about 40%...Yea...let that sink in. She is also one of the slowest characters on the ground too making her mobility on the ground pretty bad, but while she's bad on the ground she is a beast in the air which is where she shines. She also has rest which is a GREAT killmove but it also leaves her open for punishes. Also her smash attacks aren't safe for the most part. So she's all about being in the air. As for her specials I'd say you use about 2 of them and 1 of the 2 you should barely use unless you can get a really good read (Pound and Rest).Jigglypuff is the best in the air but alot of her moves in the air can be out prioritized by others so even then.. I'd say Jigglypuff isn't for everyone she's really fun to use if she's your type but if not she can be one of the worst characters.</p>
  <h2>P.S Jigglypuff is SO light if her shield is broken she will die, but she has the best shield in the game.</h2>
